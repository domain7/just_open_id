just_open_id is a Rails 3 engine for just OpenID logins using OmniAuth that connects to a User model.

The goal of this gem is to make it possible to manage accounts across multiple small apps. 

I also want to use a User model and current_user helper method in the most traditional way in each app.

1. Run your migrations for your namespaced User model.
2. Ensure you have a root path.
3. Add something like this to a template.

<% if current_user %>
  Welcome <%= current_user.name %>!
  <%= link_to "Sign Out", signout_path %>
<% else %>
  <%= link_to "Sign in with Twitter", "/auth/twitter" %>
<% end %>'
